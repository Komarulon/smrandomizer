# Super Metroid: Redesign Randomizer

Makes a randomized Super Metroid: Redesign ROM to play. 

Latest Release can be found here: https://github.com/Komarulon/smrandomizer/releases/

YOU CAN SOFTLOCK. MAKE LOTS OF SAVES. Newly added feature - Auto Backup Saves! The save file will automatically rotate when saving to help prevent hardlocks. 

Common softlocks usually involve going to places you can't get out of. For example:
- Going to Bomb Torizo without Bombs (even though bombs might be there)
- Going to West Norfair via the Brinstar Glass Tube
- Checking bomb-jump maze items without bombs or hi-jump (springball), like the item underneath the Brinstar entrance elevator
- Completing Tourian without killing Bomb Torizo

I recommend using a map! Even better, an item tracker. With EmoTracker: https://emotracker.net/ , you can download the tracker I made here: https://github.com/Komarulon/SuperMetroidRedesignRandomizerEmoTracker 

## Techniques you need to know:
- How to beat Vanilla Redesign
- Wall-jumping
- Infinite Bomb Jumping (in Redesign of course)
- Redesign movement
- Patience, because Gravity is probably somewhere in some dumb spot you won't like


Redesign Randomizer history:
- Drewseph made Super Metroid: Redesign - https://drewseph.zophar.net/
- Dessyreqt made the base Super Metroid Randomizer
- Audraxys made the randomizer work for Super Metroid: Redesign, with patches for things like "start with wall-jump" some other nice things
- Audraxys programmed in all the item location addresses, named them, and wrote the logic for each item's pickup
- Audraxys' laptop was stolen :( and the randomizer tool was lost
- However, Audraxys uploaded RomLocationsSpeedrunner.cs with all the item locations and logic, so we could recover that. Still, the above patches were lost.
- The solution? One of the previous randomized roms would have all the patches! So, this randomizer now uses an old randomized redesign ROM Audraxys generated, then re-randomizes on top of that.
