# Super Metroid: Redesign Randomizer

Makes a randomized Super Metroid: Redesign ROM to play. 

Latest Release can be found here: https://github.com/Komarulon/smrandomizer/releases/

YOU CAN SOFTLOCK. MAKE LOTS OF SAVES. Common softlocks usually involve going to places you can't get out of. For example:
- Going to Bomb Torizo without Bombs (even though bombs might be there)
- Going to West Norfair via the Brinstar Glass Tube
- Checking bomb-jump maze items without bombs or hi-jump (springball), like the item underneath the Brinstar entrance elevator

I recommend using a map! Even better, an item tracker. With EmoTracker: https://emotracker.net/ , you can download the tracker I made here: https://github.com/Komarulon/SuperMetroidRedesignRandomizerEmoTracker 

In theory, this should be exactly the same as the "current" lost version of the randomizer, however it has yet to be tested to completion (the "current" lost version HAS been tested to completion).  

Changes I know about:
- You start with wall-jump boots
- Beam Combo is not in the item pool, I think?
- ?? maybe some like softlock prevention ??
- ?? Probably some stuff that'll allow the rom to be randomized in the first place ??

Techniques you need to know:
- A bunch of stuff
- How to beat Vanilla Redesign
- Wall-jumping
- Infinite Bomb Jumping (in Redesign of course)
- Redesign movement
- Patience because Gravity is probably somewhere in some dumb spot you won't like
- How to make lots of save files

History lesson time:
- Dessyreqt made the base Super Metroid Randomizer
- Azder made it work for Super Metroid: Redesign, with patches for things like "start with wall-jump" and other various things I don't even know about
- Azder programmed in all the item location addresses, named them, and wrote the logic for each item's pickup
- Azder's laptop was stolen :( and the randomizer tool was lost
- However, Azder uploaded RomLocationsSpeedrunner.cs with all the item locations and logic, so we could recover that, but the rom patches were lost
- The solution? One of the previous randomized roms would have all the patches! So, this randomizer now uses an old randomized redesign ROM Azder sent to me

Thank you so much Azder for everything you did for this project!
